# FileConverterUtility
This is a WIP File converter built in C#.
So far, it only includes conversion to JPG and PNG, with more on the way

# Issues/How To Help
Currently we are looking to:
- Work with audio file formats, text formats, and video formats
- increase our range of photo file formats
- improve the user experience, might fork to a GUI-based application instead of console based down the road
Down the road more advanced features might be considered, such as batch/multithreaded conversions, branching out to photo/audio manipulation, etc.
