# FileConverterUtility
This is a WIP File converter built in C#.
So far, it only includes conversion to some image formats, some video formats, alongside some video codec options

The video component requires a compiled .exe or .app build of FFMPEG to work, which I cannot provide in the project files as it is too big for a free github upload.

# Issues/How To Help
Currently we are looking to:
- Work with audio file formats, text formats, and improve our range of video formats
- increase our range of photo file formats
- Improve user experience (Down the line may fork to GUI application)
- Improve reusability/readability/optimization of code
- Possibly find a video solution that wouldn't rely on an external build of FFMPEG (reduce complexity and dependancies)
- Down the road more advanced features might be considered, such as batch/folder/multithreaded conversions, branching out to photo/audio manipulation, etc.
- More types of utilities relating to files
