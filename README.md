# FileConverterUtility
This is a WIP File converter built in C#.
So far, it only includes conversion to some image formats, some video formats, alongside some video codec options

This requires a fresh download of FFMPEG to work, as it is too big for a free github upload to include in this project.

# Issues/How To Help
Currently we are looking to:
- Work with audio file formats, text formats, and improve our range of video formats
- increase our range of photo file formats
- improve the user experience, might fork to a GUI-based application instead of console based down the road
Down the road more advanced features might be considered, such as batch/multithreaded conversions, branching out to photo/audio manipulation, etc.
